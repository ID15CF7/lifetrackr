# lifetrackr
An app designed to help people take control of their lives by organizing and tracking key areas of personal growth and accountability. LifeTrackr empowers users to create meaningful habits, assign specific tasks, and monitor progress in a way thatâ€™s visually engaging and shareable. 

With LifeTrackr, users can:

- Organize their lives into core domains like Mental Health, Physical Health, Finance, Work, Relationships, and more.
- Track daily habits and tasks using an intuitive activity tracker or a GitHub-style progress view.
- Generate personalized, shareable landing pages to invite friends or family as accountability buddies.
- Stay motivated with visual progress insights and domain-specific tracking.

The goal? To simplify personal growth and create a supportive ecosystem where accountability and habit tracking drive real results. By combining powerful tracking tools with social sharing, LifeTrackr helps users stay on track while fostering collaboration and support.

This app is still a work in progress, with ongoing development planned beyond this challenge. Future updates will expand its functionality, enhance user experience, and introduce even more innovative features to help users achieve their goals.
